This file is an example README file for slave device implementations of the ALUP according to its official implementation standard

This is NOT a form to just be filled. You can add/remove anything you'd like.
Just make sure it still complies with the official implementation standard

For an example, see [Arduino-ALUP](https://github.com/Skyfighter64/Arduino-ALUP/blob/master/README.md)
