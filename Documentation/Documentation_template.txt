[Project name]

----------[Overview]------------
> quick overview to determine if this fulfills all needs of the user
> Basic description of what it can do and cannot do
> Description of what it's original use was/is
> Maybe add link to [Implementations]


----------[Requirements]------------
> System requirements
> Required dependencies (Libraries, programs)
> Optional dependencies
  > Which extra functionality does each one provide


----------[General Principles]------------
> A general, but detailed overview over the project
  > more detailed than in [Overview]
  > Using images and explanations

> explain the principles behind it
  > How does it work
  > How does it use other hard/software
    > protocols/software/hardware which it depends on and how and why


----------[Implementations]------------
> List provided implementations (code) if existing and how to properly use it (create extra documentation for each one)
> Brief description of each implementation
> Most important requirements of each implementation (Which Programming Language(s) it's designed for / Operating System / Programs it depends on)




----------[Installing]------------
> Disclaimer (?)

> Explain (again) for what the code which is about to be installed by the user is intended for
> How to Install the Project for use as intended (as described in [Overview] and the point above)
> How to Install all necessary dependencies and a brief description for what they are used for

> How to configure it to work (also Link to [Configuration])

> How to start/stop
> How to interact and how not to

> Latest version (maybe version history)


----------[Configuration]------------
> Overview of the configuration (Where to find it, how to edit/apply it)

> Configuration parameters and how to use/change them
  > Description of each parameter
    > Valid and invalid parameter values
    > Default parameter values

> Default configuration
> Example configuration(s) and its usecases





----------[Modifying]------------
> Requirements for modifications (Programs, Compilers, etc.)

> How to download the project for modification
> How to set up the downloaded files for modification
> How to modify
> How to build the modified code
  > Example command to create a build
    > Explanation of the example command
  > Common build errors and solutions (even trivial ones!!!)


> How to run the built code
  > Which steps to take before running (eg. make sure the required programs are running etc.)
  > Common execution errors and solutions (even trivial ones!!!)






----------[Detailed documentation]------------
> Detailed documentation of the project (maybe put it into an extra file / folder / website)
> Explain what each and everything does
  > Use text, images, maybe videos
  > Create a structure so it's easy to read and have an overview of everything
  > Even explain things that seem to be trivial


----------[Troubleshooting]------------
> problems which can occur during installing, building and running the project and how to solve them (even trivial ones!)
